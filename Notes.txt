 2D Arrays;
       Are arrays that contain 10 arrays.
 Why we should learn about 20 arrays.
       Because they  allow us to store multiple one D arrays which gives us more flexibility to store data.
       for example if we have to store data from Excel files we can use 2D Arrays.

 First Way:
       DataType [][] nameOfArrays= new DataType[Sizeof Rows][];
       DataType[] [] nameOfArray={data, data ,data},{data, data},{data, data, data,data}};
